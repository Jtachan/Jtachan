# Welcome to my website!

Hey, I'm Jaime Gonzalez, **@Jtachan** on GitHub and other platforms.

I develop Python (primary language) and Rust (secondary language) tools and libraries.
Everything you can find here is open-source, where I explain the full process for anyone to be able to understand and recreate the projects.

## Project index table

Here you can see a table where I organize my projects (finished, on-going and not started).
This is mostly an organizing tool for me, but you can use it to jump directly to those projects document or repository.
