# Welcome to my website :smile:

Hey, I'm Jaime Gonzalez, **@Jtachan** on GitHub and other platforms.
I develop Python (primary language) and Rust (secondary language) tools and libraries.
Everything you can find here is open-source, where I explain the full process for anyone to be able to understand and recreate the projects.
